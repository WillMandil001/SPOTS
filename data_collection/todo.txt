How to create a tactile enabled physical robot interaction dataset.

1. Get robot motions working. Simple, straight line, point to point.
2. Enforce a box limit and randomize two random points (start and finish).
3. Ensure tactile sensor is facing the correct wayduring trajectories,
4. Attach tactile sensor.
5. Read data from tactile sensor.
6. Attach camera.
7. Read data from camera.
8. Synch and store all data streams.
9. Build box for objects, get set of objects and start data collection.
10. Run for three days
